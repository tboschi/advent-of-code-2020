# Advent of code 2020

*DISCLAIMER*: this is my own attempt of [Advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/)

I will post solution here in my own time, although I will try to keep up to date with the calendar.
There will be solutions written in C++ and python (and soon in golang too).


## Compile the solutions

To compile all solutions in C++ just type
```
make cpp
```

For the solutions in python, well, there is no need to compile anything.

To compile all solutions in golang just type
```
make go
```

The compiled binaries and sources can be found in the puzzle folders `dayXX`.
Each puzzle folder contains three subfolder:
* `cpp` for the C++ solution
* `py` for the python solution
* `go` for the GO solution (when available, still learning it)

and a README that explains how to run the solution binaries.

Each code subfolder contains their it own Makefile, a part from the python one for obvious reasons.

## Puzzles

* [Day 1](day01/)
* [Day 2](day02/)
* [Day 3](day03/)
* [Day 4](day04/)
