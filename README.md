# Advent of code 2020

*DISCLAIMER*: this is my own attempt of [Advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/).

I will post solution here when I have time, typically the day after as puzzles are released at 9pm in my time zone.
There will be solutions implemented in C++ and python.


## Compile the solutions

To compile all solutions in C++ just type
```
make cpp
```

For the solutions in python, well, there is no need to compile anything.


The compiled binaries and sources can be found in the puzzle folders `dayXX`.
Each puzzle folder contains three subfolder:
* `cpp` for the C++ solution
* `py` for the python solution

and a README that explains how to run the solution binaries.

Each code subfolder contains their it own Makefile, a part from the python one for obvious reasons.
